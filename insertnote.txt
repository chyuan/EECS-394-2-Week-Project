To initialize the database that contains all of the free hours, you must prepopulate it using the insert.sql script. 
It will make a table with 168 entries that correspond to the hours in a given week. 

To do this correctly: 

make sure your database is up to date in rails: rake db:migrate

open up your mysql shell (someone who knows how this works on a mac can elaborate)

Type in shell: USE calendar2_development

Type in shell: SOURCE C:/Path/To/insert.sql

If you are able to do this correctly, update this document with better instructions.
